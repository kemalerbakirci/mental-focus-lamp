# Mental Focus Desk Lamp - Python Dependencies
# 
# Current dependencies are minimal as we're using standard library modules:
# - random (for sensor simulation)
# - time (for main loop timing)
#
# Future dependencies may include:
# numpy>=1.21.0          # For advanced data processing
# matplotlib>=3.5.0      # For data visualization
# pandas>=1.3.0          # For data analysis
# scipy>=1.7.0           # For signal processing
